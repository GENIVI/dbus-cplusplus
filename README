Debugging
---------
To compile debugging code configure the project with the --enable-debug option. Then at runtime you may set the environment variable "DBUSXX_VERBOSE=1" to activate debugging and to '0' to deactivate debugging.


Hints
-----
Your applications based on dbus-c++ have to support PTHREAD and to export the variable HAVE_PTHREAD_H.


BUGS:
-----
- dbus seems to stop working sometimes (only seen with ecore integrattion)
- ecore dbus integration is really "raw" (but working) at the moment
