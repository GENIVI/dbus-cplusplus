Debugging
---------
To compile debugging code configure the project with the --enable-debug option. Then at runtime you may set the environment variable "DBUSXX_VERBOSE=1" to activate debugging and to '0' to deactivate debugging.

Hints
-----
Your applications based on dbus-c++ have to support PTHREAD and to export the variable HAVE_PTHREAD_H. This is a work in progress and my change.
